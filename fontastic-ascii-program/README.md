# FONTASTIC

**FONTASTIC** is a playful and compact web application that transforms alphabetical letters into ASCII art using PHP, HTML, and CSS.
This mini project was developed using [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), making local hosting and development seamless.

## Features
- Converts individual letters into stylized ASCII art
- Built with clean and modular PHP scripts
- Styled using simple CSS and interactive HTML structure

## Roadmap
While this is just the beginning, future updates may include:

- Multiple ASCII art styles per letter
- Enhanced UI with playful themes
- Support for words rather than just letters.
